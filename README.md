# Microsot Movie Project Analysis

**Authors**: Sean Hart

## Overview

This project is to create reccomendations for a possible Mircrosoft movie studio. Descriptive analysis of film financial data shows that bigger budgets movies offer a greater percentage of positive Return-on-Investment. Data shows summer months are the time of best return. Animation offers the best return for big budget movies.

## Business Problem

A new movie studio will have to make determinations on budget, type-of-films, and a release schedule. 

## Data

"The Numbers" financial data  provided production budget and gross information for 5,782 film entries. This data was paired with data from Rotten Tomatoes provided genre information as well.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis, a look at monthly trends and a look at categorical evaluations.

## Results

Subdividing films into budget tiers revealed the greatest percentage of profitable films above $60 Million. This category had the highest correlation of production budget to ROI.

## Next Steps
* Information on streaming data and its effect on the theatrical landscape.
* This project focused on production budget, other factories such as marketing and advertising should be considered.
